The XML Manager Event Interface (amxml) now generates attribute names
that are compliant with the XML 1.1 specification. Previously, an
attribute name that started with a digit would be rendered as-is, even
though attribute names must not begin with a digit. We now prefix
attribute names that start with a digit with an underscore ('_') to
prevent XML validation failures.
